# README

The project is a simple web-server application using TurboGears (Version: 2.4.3) to carry out an *in sillico* enzymatic digest of a user provided protein sequence.

## Requirements:

- Users should be able to specify min and max length, min and max molecular weight, # of missed cleavages, and specific enzyme.
- Output should be a table of peptides, with their length, molecular weight, # of missed cleavages, and amino acids to left and right of each peptide in the protein sequence.
